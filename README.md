# 💼 Job Board Flask Application

This is a web-based job board application built using Python Flask, designed to allow users to view, post, and manage job vacancies. The application was originally forked from [rimkahan888/job-board-flask](https://github.com/rimkahan888/job-board-flask) and has been enhanced with additional UI/UX improvements, functionality adjustments, and educational documentation for a final project in Software Engineering (UAS RPL 2025).
